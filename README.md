# Decentralized Social Financing Protocol

Decentralized Social Financing is based on a type of loan called pre purchasing financing pool. It consists in gathering a certain number of people interested in buying, for instance, a property each, minimizing the interest rates of regular individual loans.

#### How it works

A group of people deposits an initial pot, equally distributed, as the collateral. The pot size is calculated based on the "future purchase" value and the loan-to-value ratio. For example: a group of users want to buy a 20,000 DAI car each, the amount paid per month will depend on the number of individuals as well as the minimum duration of the financing pool.
In every cycle (e.g. weekly or monthly) a user is chosen by lottery and gets the right to get the loan, in other words, the chosen participant is granted the amount of money to buy the property.
So, for a group of a hundred participants, the minimum number of cycles is one hundred, to guarantee each user will be chosen once. Implying the users will pay the amount divided over one hundred months

If chosen, the user should pay in that specific month the same value as the individual initial deposit, and the remaining debt to complete the pot is divided amongst the other participants. The cycle repeats until all the users have been granted the amount.
